# Calculator_NX

### Currently under a rewrite. All features may not be implemented or work correctly.

Calculator_NX is my first C++ program targeted for hacked Nintendo Switches. 
Calculator_NX is a calculator program that can calculate any math expression that contain the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators.

It also has the ability to update itself when a new version is avaiable. This means you don't have to manually update the app anymore!
