# Calculator_NX

THIS APPLICATION IS COMING TO THE HB APP STORE SOON TO TAKE PLACE OF ANOTHER SIMILAR PROGRAM

This is my C++ Calculator program, ported to the Nintendo Switch.

This is a console type application, so no GUI. This is my first program so I didn't want to mess around with GUIs yet. I might add a GUI in the future.

To compile this, it's pretty self explanatory. Just download all the nesscary developer packages for libnx from devkitpro, have build-essentials on Linux or Xcode command line utils on macOS. Then type make and it should compile in a few seconds. Anyways, enjoy!
