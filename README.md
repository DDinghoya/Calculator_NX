# Calculator_NX
This is my C++ Calculator program, ported to the Nintendo Switch. Not to be confused with Calculator NX from the Homebrew App Store and GBATemp, this is my first Switch Homebrew application made from the ground up.
This is a console type application, so no GUI. This is my first program so I didn't want to mess around with GUIs yet. I might add a GUI in the future.

To compile this, it's pretty self explanatory. Just download all the nesscary developer packages for libnx from devkitpro, have build-essentials on Linux or Xcode command line utils on macOS. Then type make and it should compile in a few seconds. Anyways, enjoy!
